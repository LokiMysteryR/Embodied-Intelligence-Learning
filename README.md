# Embodied Intelligence Learning Journey

This repository serves as a reflection of my journey to become a full-stack engineer in the field of **Embodied Intelligence** and **Robotics**. My goal is to build a strong foundation in programming, control systems, reinforcement learning, and robotics, focusing on practical, hands-on projects.

## My Learning Goals
- Master programming in **C++** and **Python**.
- Deepen my understanding of **robotics**, including **kinematics**, **dynamics**, and **control systems**.
- Learn **ROS** and develop practical skills through projects.
- Dive into **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) for embodied intelligence applications.
- Build and share practical projects like **simulators**, **algorithms**, **robotic arms**, and **simple cars**.

## What to Expect Here
- **Learning progress and resources**: Key resources, courses, and materials used in my journey.
- **Projects**: Sharing simulations, control algorithms, robotics projects, and simple car projects.
- **Reflections**: Insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.

Let's keep pushing forward, and I hope to connect with like-minded individuals who are on a similar journey. Let's support each other!
